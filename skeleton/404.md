<br/>

Sometimes, when a bird cries out, 
or the wind sweeps through a tree, 
or a dog howls in a far off farm, 
I hold still and listen a long time. 

My soul turns and goes back to the place
where, a thousand forgotten years ago, 
the bird and the blowing wind
were like me, and were my brothers.

My soul turns into a tree,
and an animal, and a cloud bank. 
Then changed and odd it comes home
and asks me questions. What should I reply?

<i>â€” Hermann Hess, translated by Robert Bly</i><br/>
